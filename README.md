# Predicting-Accident-Severity
The dataset contains information about various accidents and the conditions in which those accidents took place in UK in the year 2018
The aim is to predict the severity of an accident based on several conditions like the weather conditions, street light conditions, speed of the vehicle, road type, location of the accidents, date & time of the accidents, number of casualties, and presence of a police officer.
Since, our more than 70% of the dataset is categorical, we train a model using Random Forest Classifier model to get 79.7% accuracy.
